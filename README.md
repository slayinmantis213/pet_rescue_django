## Features
- Currency system where player is given 10 gifts to start and may earn gifts via "play" interaction
- When "rescuing" pets player is given 3 random pets to choose from with only their avatar photo and type and player must choose one.
- Pets have a simple stat block with current level, health, energy, happiness, and experience
